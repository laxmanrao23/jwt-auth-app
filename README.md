Designed and developed a full-stack web application using React.js for frontend and Spring Boot for backend services.

Implemented secure authentication and authorization using JWT, including login, signup, OTP-based password reset, and role-based access control.

Built RESTful APIs for user management, job listings, and account lifecycle operations (create, read, update, delete).

Integrated MongoDB Atlas for scalable data storage and handled schema design and repository layers.

Implemented email-based OTP delivery for secure password recovery and account verification.

Managed environment-specific configurations (local & production) using environment variables.

Deployed frontend and backend applications to cloud platforms, ensuring production readiness.

Handled error handling, validation, and security configurations using Spring Security.

Followed clean architecture principles with separation of controller, service, and repository layers.

Used Git & GitHub for version control and continuous deployment workflows.

Performed end-to-end testing of APIs using Swagger and integrated frontend-backend communication.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
